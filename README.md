# PNTDeepBrainModels

This github repo includes pre-trained niftynet models and config files for skull stripping MRIs. Models were generated using the niftynet platform (https://niftynet.io), an open source convolutional neural networks platform for medical image analysis.

For information about how these models were generated please see the following paper:
